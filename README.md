In this project, I demonstrate how to segmenting the customers into several categories which called RFM Analysis.
This particular analysis will analyzed the customer behavior by their recency, frequency, and monetary:
  - Recency is about how recent was the customer's last purchase
  - Frequency which about how often the customer make a purchase in a given period
  - And monetary which tells how much money did the customer spend in this given period

By doing this analysis, company can segmenting their customers into different groups based on these three factors, allowing the company to understand their customer base better strategies to treat them accordingly. By identifying high-value, loyal, and potentially at-risk customers, the company can optimize their marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and ultimately increase revenue and profitability.

At last, I also visualize the result via tableau so it can more interactive and more interative for the users to get the data based
on condition they wanted to know.
